# ImperialCAD Bridge for JG-Dealership

This resource automatically registers purchased vehicles in **ImperialCAD** when a player buys a car through **JG-Dealership**.  

---

## ‚úÖ Features

- Vehicles are **auto-registered in CAD** when purchased.
- Registered owner is set using the player‚Äôs **numeric SSN** from CAD.
- **VINs auto-generate** with `EKY` prefix and a valid check digit (no punctuation, strictly alphanumeric).
- Plates are sent with one space preserved (e.g. `123 ABC`).
- **Make/Model cleanup**:  
  - Strips out bad/unknown values.  
  - Removes agency suffixes (e.g. ‚ÄúMorgan SO‚Äù, ‚ÄúPolice‚Äù).  
  - Keeps `(Marked)` / `(Unmarked)` suffixes when present.
- Insurance is automatically created with:
  - `insuranceStatus`: Active  
  - `insurancePolicyNum`: `POL-<PLATE>`  
- Title issue date is automatically generated.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitation: Expiration Date

ImperialCAD‚Äôs DMV **Plate Return screen does not display any of the expiration fields we can send via API** (`regExpDate`, `expirationDate`, `titleExpDate`, etc.).

üëâ Because of this, **Expiration Date will always appear blank** after auto-registration.  

Players (or admins) must **manually set the expiration date** inside CAD after the vehicle is registered.

---

## Player Instructions

1. Buy your vehicle through the dealership as normal.  
2. Open **ImperialCAD** ‚Üí **Vehicles** ‚Üí locate your new vehicle.  
3. Edit the record and set the **Expiration Date** manually.  
   - Default rule (our server): **1 year from purchase date**.  
   - Example: Purchased on `2025-09-01` ‚Üí Expiration = `2026-09-01`.

---

## Configuration

- **Registration Length**: Change in `server.lua`  
  ```lua
  local REG_EXPIRES_IN_MONTHS = 12
  ```
- VIN prefix is hard-coded to `EKY`.
- Registration state is hard-coded to `KY`.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Car not showing in CAD?**  
  - Check that `ImperialCAD` resource is running before `imperialcad_bridge`.  
  - Verify `imperial_community_id` and `imperialAPI` are set correctly in `server.cfg`.

- **Expiration Date still blank?**  
  - This is expected. CAD currently does not read the API fields we provide for expiration.
